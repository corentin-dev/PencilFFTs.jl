# PencilFFTs.jl

Fast Fourier transforms of MPI-distributed Julia arrays.

This package provides functionality to distribute multidimensional arrays among
MPI processes, and to perform multidimensional FFTs (and related transforms) on
them.
This functionality is typically required for numerically solving physical
equations using pseudo-spectral methods in high-performance computing clusters
(a classical example is the Navier-Stokes equations describing hydrodynamic
turbulence).

The name of this package originates from the decomposition of 3D domains along
two out of three dimensions, sometimes called *pencil* decomposition.
This is illustrated by the figure below
([source](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-02084215v1)).
Typically, one wants to compute FFTs on a scalar or vector field along the
three spatial dimensions.
In the case of a pencil decomposition, 3D FFTs are performed one dimension at
a time (along the non-decomposed direction, using a serial FFT implementation).
Global data transpositions are then needed to switch from one pencil
configuration to the other and perform FFTs along the other dimensions.

Since it is relatively easy to write efficient generic code in Julia, this
package actually supports decomposition of domains of arbitrary dimension `N`,
along an arbitrary number of dimensions `M < N`.
(Although domains other than 3D have not been tested!)
