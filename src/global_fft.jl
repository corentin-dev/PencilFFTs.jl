    GlobalFFTParams{N}

Specifies the global parameters for an N-dimensional distributed transform.
These include the global data sizes of input and output data, as well as the
transform types to be performed along each dimension.

---

    GlobalFFTParams(size_global, transforms)

Define parameters for N-dimensional transform.

`transforms` must be a tuple of length `N` specifying the transforms to be
applied along each dimension. Each element must be a subtype of
[`Transforms.AbstractTransform`](@ref). For all the possible transforms, see
[`Transform types`](@ref Transforms).

Note that the transforms are applied one dimension at a time, with the leftmost
dimension first for forward transforms.

# Example

To perform a 3D FFT of real data, first a real-to-complex FFT must be applied
along the first dimension, followed by two complex-to-complex FFTs along the
other dimensions:

```julia
size_global = (64, 32, 128)  # size of real input data
transforms = (Transform.RFFT(), Transform.FFT(), Transform.FFT())
fft_params = GlobalFFTParams(size_global, transforms)
```
